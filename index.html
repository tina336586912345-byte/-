    I know you asked me not to send you any messages, but I just want to let you know—one last time—how much I’ve loved you.
    You once asked me when I felt disrespected, and this is my answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    You did give me feelings that I had never experienced before. In the beginning, I could feel how hard you tried to understand me, at least in some sense.
    Even though we are very different in certain ways, I still tried to express myself while also compromising parts of who I am.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later on, when I expressed myself, you started to say that I had a stupid mind and stupid thoughts.
    But those thoughts were never stupid.
    You began to use only your own standards to judge and pressure me, and that’s when we started fighting a lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    We did have things that were difficult to overcome—our ideologies are different at a structural level.
    But you saw mine as stupid, and that’s when I truly felt disrespected.
    Even though I really didn’t like some of your ideas either, I tried my best not to say anything hurtful.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m not saying this to blame you.
    I know you might not understand it that way, and maybe even now you still feel the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I want to say is that I truly value the time we had, and I loved it.
    Looking at our photos and the memories that remain in my mind still makes me happy—though now there is sadness as well.
    We were really shining when we were together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for making me feel special, and thank you for the kind words you gave me.
    At that time, I felt like I owned the world.
    Thank you, Oman, for bringing us together.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will still love you in some way in the future, because I know you from my heart.
    I love you, and I will stay with you even if it’s not physical anymore.
    I believe that, spiritually, we are alike—we recognized each other from the very beginning.
    That’s why everything felt so intense at first.
  </p>

  <p>
    We became what we are because we are blocked by what society imposes on us,
    and by what we have learned from the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    All in all, I wish you a very bright future—one where you can truly find yourself.
    I also wish that you find your real home.
    I was genuinely happy when you once saw me as yours. 🤍
